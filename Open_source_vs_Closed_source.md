## 1. Control & Customization
| Aspect               | Open-Source Model (e.g., TinyLlama, Mistral)                                                       | OpenAI Model (e.g., GPT-3.5/4 via API)                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Access**      | You can download the model weights and run locally. Full control over architecture and parameters. | You never see model weights—fine-tuning is done via API only.                             |
| **Customization**    | Can change architecture, training method, LoRA layers, tokenizers, etc.                            | Limited to training with your dataset; no changes to architecture or tokenizer.           |
| **Prompt Templates** | Fully customizable—you can bake formatting into training.                                          | Prompt structure still matters, but you can’t “hard-wire” it into the model architecture. |

## 2. Data Privacy
| Aspect            | Open-Source                                                                                                         | OpenAI                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Location** | All training happens on your machine or your chosen server/cloud—data never leaves your control.                    | Data is uploaded to OpenAI servers for fine-tuning (though they commit not to use it to train other models).          |
| **Compliance**    | Easier to meet strict legal/compliance requirements (e.g., medical, legal) if you have to keep data fully in-house. | May need data-sharing agreements or can’t use sensitive data if regulations forbid sending it to third-party servers. |
